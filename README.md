# Ford-Credit-Co
## This is for the Ford Credit interview exercises.
I have implemented the first exercise (distance calculator). I added a .txt file that can automate answers for you. The .txt file should install into the same directory as the .py file, but if it does not for some reason move it to the same level in the directory.

### Locate the ManhattanDistance.py file inside of the Ford-Credit-Co folder and run the following command:
> python ManhattanDistance.py

If you have python3 installed do the following:
> python3 ManhattanDistance.py

### You can then follow the instructions on the screen.

The given points in the .txt file are given below with their respetive distances:

> Start       (1,3)
> 
> Destination (-1,2)
> 
> **Distance =  3**

> Start       (3,4)
> 
> Destination (9,6)
> 
>**Distance =  8**

> Start       (13,3)
> 
> Destination (18,8)
> 
> **Distance =  10**

### You can also choose to enter your own points. If you choose to do so keep in mind the formatting
> (first input, second input), (third input, fourth input)
> 
> Start (x, y), Destination (x, y)
>
